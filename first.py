## Plant the seed on your map

## Water the seed with your thoughts (your completed goals)
### Define the scope of your seed
### What is the purpose of your seed?
### Write the code that makes it

# Connect to a larger idea
## Develop a game that will help everyone learn cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and software coding techniques that helps them achieve their dreams and goals.

### Create a dream map
